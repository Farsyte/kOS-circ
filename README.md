# Experiments in Precision Circularization

The goal of this is project is to compare several methods for
circularization of orbits in Kerbal Space Program, using scripts
written for the "kOS" (Kerbal Operating System) mod.

## Test Configuration

### Installing Kerbal Space Program

- Kerbal Space Program, version 1.0.5
- kOS version 0.18.2
- ModuleManager (installed via dependency)
- RemoteTech

I currently lack a mechanism to have my vehicles stream telemetry to
the ground, so for the purposes of this set of experiments I will be
disabling the KOS integration with RemoteTech, and will be running the
evaluations after a "SWITCH TO 0" statement.

### Perparation

I was inspired to do this by the "Kerbal Space Programming" series of
videos on YouTube by CheersKevin (Cheers, Kevin!) so I am going to
establish my game saves state to where it was when I started to think
about this: during the launch of OmniSat 1.

So pause this for a bit while I rewind to the beginning and bring my
new installation up to the desired save point.
